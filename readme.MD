## About

Campfire is a Room Design Concept that tackles the challenge of a 360 conference room. It's not a formal product of Cisco, but is a solution put together that takes advantage of native features or the product and uses the devices xAPI to build out a new solution.

The challenge that needed solving was to enable speaker tracking in all side of a space coupled with the fact that a Cisco Codec were built to support 1 speakertracking camera. By leveraging additional codecs in a room design to drive more instances of speakertrack and using the device's xAPI we can coordinate all 4 systems to operate as one and provide a solution to this challenge.

## Key Terminology [<img src="/images/view-list-circle_100_w.png" alt="table of contents" width="25"/>](#table-of-contents)

| **Term** | **Definition** |
|---|---|
| AZM/AZM Library | Acronym for the Audio Zone Manager Library. This library contains the logic needed for clean audio based events |
| GMM/GMM Lite Lib | Acronym for the Global Macro Messaging Library. GMM Lite is a modified version of the original GMM, that removes all tools not in use in the Campfire Solution. GMM enables a simplified set of inter-macro/codec communication, read and write functionality |
| Primary/Primary Codec | References the codec in the room design that is the main device for video conferencing and hosts the bulk of the responsibility for the overall campfire solution. |
| Node/Node Codec | References the codec(s) in the room design that report to the primary and functions as a modified peripheral for the Primary Codec. |
| Audio Zone | A concept that defines a region of audio we use to assign microphone too. Each Audio Zone must be defined and mapped to a camera resource in order to enable the solution |                                                                              |

## User Guide [<img src="/images/view-list-circle_100_w.png" alt="table of contents" width="25"/>](#table-of-contents)

### User Interface
- The Campfire Blueprint enables a new UserInterface Panel called **Campfire Controls**. This panel is accessible in both the HomeScreen and Call Controls.

[![Campfire Touch Panel Home Screen](/images/campfire_homescreen.png)](#)

- When selected, several rows of elements are accessible to the user
  - **Info**: Provides a text description of the active Mode 
  - **Mode**: A group of campfire automation behaviors a user can choose. The default choice will be selected when first enabled, and any time a call ends
    - **Speaker**: Updates the MainSource with the last captured active speaker with Closeup active. This mode has a configurable timeout to allow faster or slower switching.
    - **Everyone**: Updates the MainSource to all 4 cameras in a 2x2 grid with Frames active. This is a static mode. The speaker by a combination of the in room microphones and the Speakertracking Camera.
    - **Conversation**: Updates the MainSource dynamically to any and all active speakers with Closeup Active. This modes is configurable to allow faster or slower switching. The speaker by a combination of the in room microphones and the Speakertracking Camera.
  - **Selfview**: Quick access to show/hide the selfview window and the ability to show this in fullscreen

[![Campfire Touch Panel Campfire Controls Interface](/images/campfire_controls.png)](#)

- As a user selects a mode under the Campfire Controls Interface, the group button will reflect the choice, update the info text description and prompt the OSD with a message, indicating the active mode.
  - The OSD message will be visible for only a few seconds, and will prompt again when a user places a call as a visual reminder of the active Campfire Mode

[![Campfire OSD Mode Prompt](/images/campfire_osd.png)](#)

- Not selectable by the user under Campfire Controls is a **Muted** mode.
  - The Muted mode occurs when a user mutes the codec on the touch panel and/or on a Cisco microphone
  - Muted Mode will disabled Speakertracking and microphone automation to provide the remote participant a full view of all participants in the space as well as compose all cameras in a grid.
  - Muted Mode will prompt on the OSD when this occurs
  - While microphones are muted, when a user selects a new Campfire Mode, a reminder prompt will surface on the touch panel, and give them the ability to unmute their audio.
  - When the device unmutes, the currently selected mode will activate.

## Room Dimensions [<img src="/images/view-list-circle_100_w.png" alt="table of contents" width="25"/>](#table-of-contents)

- The room should not measure less than 9x9m (30x30’). This will allow for enough space for users to move comfortably around the campfire setup. 
- The provided measurements for the campfire setup has carefully been considered to provide an optimal in-room and far-end experience.
- The mounting height of the cameras, their relative position to the screens and distance to the position where the local participants are seated, ensure good eye contact both in-room and for remote attendees. 
- The fixed distance between the screens and the edge of the table secures a free line of sight from the local participants to the video participants and shared digital content. 

[![Room Dimensions](/images/campfire-room-dimensions.png)](#)

- Segmented table to avoid participants sitting in the blind spots of the cameras
- Segmented tables also offers ease of access for maintenance and cleaning at the center
- Custom design table with the courtesy panels are integrated into the shape*
- Table shape is custom to optimize on footprint and experience
- Make sure the technical equipment in the center island have sufficient ventilation and cooling

[![Furniture TopView](/images/campfire-furniture-topview.png)](#)

- Note the privacy panels in the front of each table. Whereas the Quadcamera is mounted in a format outside it's normal deployment, the camera will have visibility under each table. So it's important to source tables with a privacy panel in the front or at least a table cloth.

[![Furniture SideView](/images/campfire-furniture-sideview.png)](#)

- Cisco table shape reference for ideal user experience
- Courtesy panels is recommended in the setup integration
- Final implementation to be done with furniture partner of choice

### Solution Components

#### Recommended Components

| Recommended Cisco Hardware | QTY | 3rd Party Components                        | QTY |
|----------------------------|-----|---------------------------------------------|-----|
| Codec Pro (Primary Codec)  | x1  | 50" Display                                 | x8  |
| Codec EQ (Node Codec)      | x3  | HDMI Distribution Amplifier (HDMI Splitter) | x2  |
| Quadcamera                 | x4  | POE Switch (16 Port Minimum)                | x1  |
| Table Microphone Pro       | x8  | Custom Furniture                            | x1  |
| Room Navigator             | x1  | Installation and Configuration              | x1  |

**NOTE**: HDMI DAs/Splitters can break CEC Communication, it's recommended to source a HDMI DA that can address this break in comunication to the displays in order to power them on and off as the codec pro changes Standby State

#### Node Codec Alternatives
- Codec Pro
- Codec Plus

#### Microphone Alternatives
- AES67 Microphones
- Directional Analog Microphones

### Video Output Connections

- Video Output Connectors 1 and 2 from the Codec Pro are fed into the Partner sourced HDMI Distribution Amplifier
- The new Outputs from Each DA are distributed to all 8 displays so that each side of the campfire has a duplicate output feed for both output 1 and 2 of the Codec Pro
- HDMI Output 3 is unused. You could either add another source output in your space, or integrate an HDMI to USB Capture device and leverage the [Call from Laptop BYOD feature](https://help.webex.com/en-us/article/ney3qxe/Call-from-laptop-using-your-Cisco-device-as-a-web-camera#Cisco_Reference.dita_d3c1dbe8-4263-4d55-b19f-6a49478be4c5)

[![Video Output Connections](/images/campfire_connections_videoOut.png)](#)

### Video Input Connections

- HDMI Input 1 on the Codec Pro connects to the Primary Codec's own Quadcamera
- HDMI Inputs 2-4 on the Codec Pro take in the HDMI Output signal of the Codec EQ's HDMI Output 1
  - Each Node Quadcamera's Video Output signal is feed into their respective Node Codec EQ HDMI Input 1
- HDMI Input 5 is reserved for Laptop Connections
  - It may be worthwhile to integrate a 4x1 HDMI switcher, in order to place a Laptop Connection on all 4 tables
  - Keep in mind, these devices also support wireless sharing via Webex Proximity Services, Airplay and Miracast too, so it may not be necessary
- HD-SDI Input 6 is unused, consider integrating a PTZ Camera in you design if needed, just know the Macros would need some edits to allow for that

[![Video Input Connections](/images/campfire_connections_videoIn.png)](#)

### Network Connections

- All 4 Codecs should connect to the customer Lan for Management and Updates
- Primary Codec Pro
  - Connect the Ethernet Control line of the Primary Codec Pro's Quadcamera to the first Link Local Port of the Primary Codec Pro
  - Connect the POE switch to the second Link Local Port of the Primary Codec Pro
    - Connect all 8 Table Microphone Pros to the POE Switch
    - You may connect additional Table Navigators and/or PTZ Camera Control lines to this switch if modifying the solution design
  - Connect the Room Navigator to the fourth Link Local Port of the Primary Codec Pro
    - You may also connect this to the POE switch for simplicity
- Node Codec EQ
  - For each Node Codec EQ, Connect the Ethernet Control line of the Node Codec EQ's Quadcamera to the first Link Local Port of the respective Node Codec EQ

[![Network Connections](/images/campfire_connections_network.png)](#)

### Audio Output Connections

- The Primary Quadcamera will receive audio over ARC
- All other Quadcameras must have a Euroblock to TRS 3.5mm connection
  - All Audio passes though the Primary Codec Pro, do not connect any Audio via the Node Codecs

[![Audio Output Connections](/images/campfire_connections_audioOut.png)](#)

### Audio Input Connections

- For Ethernet Audio Connections (Both AES67 and Cisco Ethernet Mic), connect these to the POE Switch

[![Ethernet Audio Input Connections](/images/campfire_connections_ethernetAudioIn.png)](#)

- For Analog Audio Connections, connect each microphone to the Microphone 4pin Euroblock connectors on the back of the Primary Codec Pro
- If you plan on using a DSP for Audio Expansion, it would be good to break out 8 Analog Audio Lines and feed them into the codec, as each input at this point could serve as a unique audio zone

## FAQ [<img src="/images/view-list-circle_100_w.png" alt="table of contents" width="25"/>](#table-of-contents)

### Is Campfire supported by Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC)?
- No, Cisco TAC will not support the Campfire Solution as it's considered customer code
- TAC will support the RoomOS Software and your Codec Hardware for it's normal operation, such as Speakertrack.
- You will need to engage your AV Partner for support, but the code is open for anyone to troubleshoot

### Will Campfire work on a Codec Pro running as a Microsoft Teams Room (MTR)?
- As of January 2024, no, there is an API limitation in the Macro Code. This API limitation stops the campfire solution from operating.

### Can I use the Room Bar or the Room Bar Pro as the camera, instead of a Codec with a Quadcamera
- The Campfire blueprint in it's current state, is outlined to use all Quadcameras
- If your space is uniquely different, the Room Bar/RoomBar Pro can be used, but the Macros will need to be altered to suit that build.
  - Not impossible, but may need a little extra TLC to get going

### Can I add a PTZ Camera?
- Yes and No
  - Yes, as you have an extra HD-SDI input available to add a Camera
  - No, as the camera switching in the Macro is on all the time, so you'll need to edit the Macro to include a PTZ in your solution

### How can I get help?
- Review the Guides above, there is alot of detail that can help :smiley:
- You can join a Community Supported Space on Webex
  - https://eurl.io/#nJWdM3w_T
  - NOTE: This is a community supported space. There is no guarantee of assistance in this space, it's a space filled with community members who may or may not answer questions or provide feedback; all is best effort. Should you need hands on assistance, please engage either your Cisco Sales Engineer and/or Cisco Technical Solutions Engineer or an AV Vendor Partner.
